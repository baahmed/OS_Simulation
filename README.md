# OS_Simulation

Simulation is an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or a system, that represents its opration over time..

This project's aim is to simulate an operating system by creating and scheduling processes as well as using semaphores when needed to ensure the correct usage of critical resources. System calls are also supported.
